# ProjectFlow Learning

Practice repo for Angular + .NET with a focus on clean architecture, testing, and professional workflow.

## Structure
- notes/            -> roadmap + decisions + learnings
- mini-projects/    -> isolated exercises (Angular / .NET)
- projectflow/      -> the main app (API + later frontend)

## Principles
- No filler code.
- Small commits per milestone.
- Theory only when it supports practice.

## How to run (backend)
(Added when API is implemented.)
