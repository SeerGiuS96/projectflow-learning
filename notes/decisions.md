# Decisions

## General
- This repo is practice + portfolio-quality code.
- Small commits per milestone.
- Notes are short: decisions, gotchas, mental models.

## Backend
- .NET 8 (LTS).
- Layers: Api / Application / Domain / Infrastructure.
- Start simple; deepen later (validation, patterns, DDD).

## Frontend
- Angular latest stable.
- Prefer modern Angular patterns (standalone, signals).
