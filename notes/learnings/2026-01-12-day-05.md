# Day 5 — Repositories, Ports & DI alignment

## What I did
- Added GetProjects query use case.
- Introduced IProjectRepository as an Application port.
- Implemented ProjectRepository in Infrastructure using EF Core.
- Fixed DI to rely on extension methods instead of manual registrations.
- Removed duplicated IProjectRepository that caused namespace conflicts.

## Key mental models
- Application defines contracts (ports); Infrastructure implements them.
- If two interfaces have the same name but different namespaces, DI will break in subtle ways.
- Ports belong in a dedicated folder to avoid accidental duplication.
- Program.cs should not become a dumping ground for service registrations.

## Mistakes / gotchas
- Creating a new interface without checking if one already exists.
- Forgetting to update use cases after moving an interface.
- Starting work without pulling first (resolved with stash + merge).

## What is now stable
- Clean Architecture boundaries are enforced again.
- Repositories are correctly wired through ports.
- Build passes without hacks or workarounds.

## Next (tomorrow)
- Day 6: Application unit tests (GetProjectsHandler).
- Use Moq + FluentAssertions.
- No EF Core, no API, only handlers + mocks.
